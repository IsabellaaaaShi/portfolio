The Culinary Axes is a proposed culinary institute project situated in Frick Park of Squirrel Hill, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It is a three-person group project dedicated to the Kaiseki chef Niki Nakayama. 

Niki Nakayama’s cooking philosophy lies heavily in the idea of nature. After deriving an abstracted and orthogonal field system from the chef’s philosophies, a linear arrangement of space that flows according to the terrain was concluded. 

The central axis brings the entire design together, focusing on public space and circulation while allowing maximum sunlight and capitalizing on the hillside view. 

The secondary axis counters yet complements the main axis by dividing space into 4 quadrants while focusing on education. 

Overall, the Culinary Axes incorporates elements from Kaiseki cuisine, the importance of linear forms and hierarchy, and influences from the natural biome to shape the structure and landscape. This space acts as a community node for gathering, interaction, and excellent cuisine as an ample addition to Squirrel Hill and the greater Pittsburgh region.
