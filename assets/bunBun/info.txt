Bun Bun Bake Shop is a mockup of a online store for cinnamon rolls. The webpage was written from the start with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The store includes three sub-pages: the main product page, the product detail page, and the cart page. Through a step-by-step process of implementing layout and individual webpage functions, users can browse the cinnamon rolls, select different cinnamon roll types, change the glazing of each cinnamon roll, and add them to the cart with different configurations. The webpage is dynamic and gives real time response.
