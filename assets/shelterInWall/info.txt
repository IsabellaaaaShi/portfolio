The project aims to create a semi-enclosed structure located in the Indochina subtropical forest. The goal of this project is to shelter people from the rain and sun while allowing wind to pass through and providing access to the natural environment.

During the design process, several key aspects were considered. The first is climate. The site has heavy precipitation, low altitude, and heat. Here, stilt structures reference the precedent study to avoid flooding. The structure’s roof mimics the slanted rooftops of Thai houses to shelter from the rain, drain water, and allow hot air to rise to the top and circulate.

The second consideration is material and form. Referencing the precedents’ utilization of locally available bamboo and wood, the Shelter-In Wall plays with the arrangement of wood structures. The material ensures the simplicity of construction and deconstruction. 

The notion of wood is interesting: it was a former part of the natural environment. However, now, it not only functions as a barrier for people from unpleasant aspects, but also works as a linked connection with the surroundings. Thai and Lao architecture also avoid the use of nails but rather focus on joints to lock structure together, which is also a structural aspect this shelter decided to take on. 

Lastly, Thai and Lao villages contain family compounds rather than stand alone structure. Thus, this design incorporates multiple structures to create variations.
