The project is a collaboration within a team of four to design the physical and digital interfaces of an imaginary semiautonomous moped.


The design of the moped involved an iterative process of research, task analysis, physical prototyping, and digital mockup at various fidelity levels to test design feasibility. 

Enhanced consolidated human-centric design through multiple rounds of user interviews and testing
