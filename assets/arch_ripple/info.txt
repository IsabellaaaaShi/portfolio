The project is a submission to Buildner’s 3rd annual Last Nuclear Bomb Memorial competition.

The competition is organized each year in support of a universal ban on nuclear weapons. The goal is to create a conceptual memorial project to be located on any known decommissioned nuclear weapon testing site. As the submission to a ‘silent’ competition, the project does not include text and annotation of any kind and is meant to express the architectural experience through the imagery.
