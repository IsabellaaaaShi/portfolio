For this mockup, I was tasked with designing 2 artifacts for an imaginary Pittsburgh Music Festival: 1. A 1-page website and 2. 3 Social Media Posts. The website include the content provided so that concert goers can easily understand which bands are playing, when, and know how to get tickets. The social media posts highlight the lineups for each day of the festival such that users can easily know which bands are playing and where each day. 

The goal of this mockup is to practice core visual and communication design skills in organizing large amounts of content while designing a poster that inspires excitement in its user.
