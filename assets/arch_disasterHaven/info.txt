The “Disaster Haven” mobile home is designed for quick and efficient evacuation during Los Angeles natural disasters such as wildfires.

Its compact size and mobility make it ideal for fast and easy deployment, providing a safe and secure shelter for those in need. The home is constructed to be quickly deconstructible, ensuring that it can be quickly and safely removed from an area if necessary, reducing the risk of further threat of disaster. Despite its small size, Disaster Haven is designed to be a comfortable and functional living space equipped with all the basic amenities for those who may be displaced for an extended period.

Disaster Haven serves as a temporary shelter that can be swiftly distributed by the government to those in need when a fire occurs. The Whittier Narrow Recreational Area in El Monte, located in Los Angeles County, is designated as the temporary campsite where families will be able to settle with their loved ones. The site is designed to create a community, supportive environment, and relaxing view during a challenging time. Once the fire has been extinguished and the affected areas are deemed safe, the residents will return to where their homes once stood. As they watch their new houses being built, a sense of hope and resilience is instilled within the community, symbolizing a fresh start and moving forward. This mobile home design aims to not only provide practicality and functionality in times of crisis but also evoke a sense of unity and the power of rebuilding together.

The mobile home exhibits remarkable flexibility and functionalities to cater to various needs. With a single unit, the door can be propped open, along with half of the slanted wall, creating an exterior space that can be utilized for dining or simply enjoying the outdoors. Additionally, the back of the mobile home next to the bed can be propped out, forming a small, raised mini balcony that offers an elevated view of the surroundings. The windows are designed with flexible shades, allowing for privacy and controlling the amount of natural light entering the space. Moreover, the inclusion of skylights enables ample sunlight during the day and breathtaking views of the night sky. For larger families, multiple units can be joined together in various configurations to create more spacious living areas that accommodate the needs of each household. The versatility and adaptability of this mobile home design aim to enhance comfort and livability, ensuring that individuals and families can make the most of their temporary shelter during challenging times.
