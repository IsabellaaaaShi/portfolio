Based on knowledge on Information Architecture, this project aims to redesign the website for the Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh to better meet the needs of key user archetypes - the planning parent, the engaged educator, the curious kid, the supporting members, and the new-in-town parent. My goal is to enhance the museum’s online presence and improve the overall user experience. The redesign process focused on applying information architecture principles to effectively re-organize content and visual elements based on user goals. Through an iterative prototyping process, the new homepage design highlights key actions and priorities for core user groups for readability. The museum information becomes easy to find and engage with for all users.
